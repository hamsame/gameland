### About The Project
A website for a fake gaming community built with Next JS and styled components library.

### Lessons Learned
In this project I learned how to build dynamic pages using data from an API and tools such as getStaticProps and getStaticPaths from Next js. This means that I would type the general jsx elements and the javascript would enter the expected data into the chosen webpage.

I also learned how to make styled components. This was easy to learn as I just needed to install and import the package and then add the css styling I wanted.
